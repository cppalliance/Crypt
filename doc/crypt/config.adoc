== User Configurable Macros

- `BOOST_CRYPT_ENABLE_MD5`: Without this define `#include <boost/crypt/hash/md5.hpp>` will issue a `#error` because it is in-secure.

== Automatic Configuration Macros

- `BOOST_CRYPT_HAS_STRING_VIEW`: This is defined when compiling with at least C++17 and your standard library has a complete implementation of `<string_view>`.

- `BOOST_CRYPT_HAS_SPAN`: This is defined when compiling with at least C++20 and your standard library has a complete implementation of `<span>`.

- `BOOST_CRYPT_HAS_CUDA`: This is defined when compiling with either NVCC or NVRTC regardless of the host compiler.
